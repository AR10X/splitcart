# 🛒 SplitCart

**The Social Way to Order Groceries Together**

---

## 🚨 The Problem

Grocery ordering today is **individual, repetitive, and inefficient**:

* Friends or flatmates order separately → higher delivery fees.
* No easy way to split bills fairly.
* Group ordering apps don’t exist — people hack it with WhatsApp + UPI.

---

## 💡 Our Solution — SplitCart

**SplitCart** turns grocery ordering into a **shared experience**:

* Create a cart → share a simple code → invite friends in seconds.
* Each member **adds their own items**.
* Fees are **split automatically**, no manual math.
* Everyone pays their share → order placed together. 🎉

> **Think Blinkit + Splitwise.**
> Groceries, but social, collaborative, and frictionless.

## ✨ Why Now?

* **Quick commerce is exploding** in India (Blinkit, Zepto, Swiggy Instamart).
* **Shared living (PGs, hostels, flatmates)** is the norm for Gen Z & young professionals.
* **Digital payments** (UPI) make real-time split billing possible.
